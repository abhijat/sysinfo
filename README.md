# sysinfo

This is a clojure library to examine running processes and other system information on the Linux operating system.

It exposes information from the /proc filesystem to the programming environment.

The following fields are displayed per process at this time:

1. process id
2. user id
3. user info (username, home directory, login shell)
4. Memory stats (size, resident, shared, text, data)
5. Command line for the process

This is a work in progress, right now only the process interface is available.

Some of the commands that can be executed from the repl are:

1. See all the running processes:
`(processes)`

2. See the commands associated with running processes:
`(map :cmdline (processes)`

3. Find all java processes
`(filter #(re-find #"java" (:cmdline %)) (processes)`

4. See all running processes with their environment variables
`(processes true`

The processes can also display their environment variables. This is suppressed by default for both security and
readability. 

The uberjar generated by this project pretty-prints the output of `(processes)` on the current system.
